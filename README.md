# NetworkRewardGenerator (in progress)
- Find optimal reward/penalty stimulus for spiking neural networks.

## Plan
- Reproduce the model and core results in the paper _Shaping Embodied Neural Networks for Adaptive Goal-directed Behavior_ (Chao et al., 2008).
- Apply the framework of reinforcement learning to find the best strategy for delivering reward and penalty.
